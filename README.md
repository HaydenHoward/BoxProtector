# Overview

The character moves around the map and gets with in range of boxes that begin to follow the player. The player then needs to go to the barrel to deposit the boxes. Once all the boxes have been collected and deposited the player can then walk into the portal and go to the next level.

This game helped me have more of a understanding of C# and how to work with Unity. I also got to expeirence more of the process of game developlment to help me decide if that is something I want to pursue more.

# Development Environment

To get this game working I used Unity as my game framework and the IDE I used was Visual Studio Code. 

I wrote this game in C# and used built in libraries with the unity software.
